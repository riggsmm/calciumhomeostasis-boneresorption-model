## How to use this site ##

[OpenDiseaseModels.org](http://www.opendiseasemodels.org/) (ODM) consists of two sites, and participants are expected to use each for a specific purpose. Here is a description of the sites and information on how to use them:

### Code sites ###
The code, data sets, and documentation for each project are kept on Google Code sites. There is a Google Code site for each project. A code site should be the first place you go after visiting the homepage as you will need to familiarize yourself with a model before doing anything else.

Here's what you can do on the project sites:
  * Anyone can download project files in two ways:
    * By clicking on the Download tab and then clicking on the project ZIPs listed there.
    * By checking out the most recent revision using the instructions under the Source tab.
  * Anyone with a Google Account can add issues under the Issue tab by clicking new issue (Go here for more        information on how to create a Google Account).
  * Project members can check in new revisions, add new uploads, and make other changes to the site. The project  member status will only be granted to the core development team.

### The Homepage ###
This site, located at http://www.opendiseasemodels.org. It contains introductory information, project forums and links to all project sites.

In order to post to the forums, you will need to sign up for an account on [OpenDiseaseModels.org](http://www.opendiseasemodels.org/). You can do this by clicking the Register link at the top of the Forums page.

Each project has its own forum where you may discuss ideas and post code. To contribute ideas for new [OpenDiseaseModels.org](http://www.opendiseasemodels.org/) projects, please post to the General Project Discussion forum.
